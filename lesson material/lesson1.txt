Welcome to vim, one of the most powerful text editor's in the world!

The first thing you should learn about vim is that it has two different modes: Insert and Edit.

By hitting the ESC key you can enter edit mode where you have access to a large number of useful and powerful commands that are accessed using
certain hotkeys.

The two most important commands for you at the moment are the 'i' key which stands for Insert and the 'u' key which stands for Undo.
